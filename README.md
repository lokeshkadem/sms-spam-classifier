An SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning model designed to automatically identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate SMS text messages.
By analyzing the content and characteristics of SMS messages, the classifier distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages, enhancing user experience and security. Common techniques involve natural language processing (NLP) and various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks to achieve high accuracy in spam detection.
